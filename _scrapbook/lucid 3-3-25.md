# lucid 3-3-25

in room, hear somone in hallway, its my mother, she is going into some attick space. i put some japanese girl humming on loop in my earphones. tje sound was mesmorizing. realize im in a dream, so i find my way out of the dream then back in it, HH walks into my room talking about tuffts of hair at the *edge of the feild* Says that M would like to see it, something to do with a cat that has been lurking around the house, it died or killed something. I say ok, tell HH to grab M and I then walk down hallway to first window i see, crawl out of window onto roof, he seems to be ok with it. jump off roof, begin to float down, the world is so blurry and grey all around, its always blurry in the distance, i think that must man something. float to ground, but begin to feel like im fallling, i didnt have as much control as i thought, i hear firetrucks. I wake up.

# "AA" Walmart Light pole, Medical Imaging.


"Aa" : Younger brother angry, strange Walmart parkinglot, I'm in a fast car, someone ripped out one of the light pulls, glass starts raining everywhere, he was angry at someone named CJ. I told him to get in the car.

"Medical Imaging" : I was in a hospital, I had to get some part of me scanned, I got it scanned and later went back to that hospital where they showed me a real life 1:1 model of the part of me they scanned, it contained all the correct blood vessel, muscles, nerves, and what seemed to be a problem that the doctors has to remedy. The nurse told me that the imaging machine automatically made a 3d scale 1:1 model out of some material so the doctors could use it for experimentation.

# Finding a Cult, Murderer Honda, Dancing with Putin


Mar-07-2025

The dream began with myself being in some area by a somewhat busy street, but on the other side of this street was a bus stop and a patch of woods, tatted clothed children began to crawl out of little holes in the wall of these dense woods. I walked into this patch of woods to find wooden cabins, and inside these cabins sickly but happy looking children, some sleeping on wooden benches inside the house, there was nothing inside these cabins expect little benches. They told me all about there leaders and there group. The forest was dead pines, expect the front wall of trees facing the road and the tops of the pine trees which were alive. The sun shown through those pines. I was approached by a child who was a bit older than the other children, he has dirty blond hair, he began to tell me the name of this settlement and that the leaders would be there soon. He said I would love it here. Something in me got a bad feeling about being there. A leader arrived, she was a portly almost trailer trashy white women with a muffin top and groceries, she began to tell me that this place gets a bad wrap but it wasn't all that bad. I walked back out of the woods and all the kids and the muffin top lady waved goodbye and said come back whenever you like, you have a new home here. As I left the woods, SG's uncle B was parked there in his truck. He told me that that was a cult and to stay away from them. I remember he was much skinner. Then SG showed up and wanted to talk and hang out with me. I began to tell her about those people and she seemed confused.

My Hondas throttle got stuck and began to smash into buildings, back up and flip, I was in the car but wasn't scared  about it, It was more like I wanted it to kill my car by hitting things as it seemed to want to kill me.

My family and I became friends with Vladimir Putin, we were in some strange lakeside mansion, it looked like it was on the black sea. We went to some formal gathering and I remember seeing him shirtless and laughing, we all seemed to like him.

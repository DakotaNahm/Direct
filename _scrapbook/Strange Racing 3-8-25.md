# Strange Racing 3-8-25

Dream began at my old house, a group of young men in wild unique cars, bikes, and quads belted up and down the road, at this point my father and I noticed the numbers increasing almost as if it was some sort of gang. They continued to rocket up and down the street, i remember seeing an emerald green formula drag car doing at extreme speeds. I also recall hearing quads in the woods across from the road. Gina_W and her father were there as if they came over to check on the activity. Gina was flirtatious with me, grabbing my arm and almost to pull me into her. We hopped over the stone wall to the other side to DJ's house, across from the road there was a large wooden garage built that we had not noticed before. We went into this somewhat dimly lit wooden garage to find about a dozen of these people sitting down and working on there machines. We asked if DJ had given them permission which they responded yes. I knew one of the people in the garage, his name was Ryan. Then it ended.

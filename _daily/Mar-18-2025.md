If god exists, his spectrum of being and knowing a being must be so wide and expansive that even the most distant of humans on any hierarchy must not register a blip of difference in its eyes. Although the opposite could be said, even the most minute difference can and will be viewed beyond any conceivable human metric. The drug addict is the same as the gold medal winner, and inconceivably different on all levels, at all times. Differences in humans is really about perspective and where you want to want to view it. For society it is helpful to view humans on certain metrics, but expanded these metrics are nothing in a omnipotent scope of a being and life, so too these small differences in metrics can destroy entire civilizations. Although for the sake of humans and their civilizations, it seems much better to act on your natural instinct towards perceiving these differences and moving accordingly, opposed to forcing these differences into the framework of a social construct or a religious parable.

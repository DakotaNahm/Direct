# Mar-14-2025, Identifying Neurosis

Another somewhat nice spring day. Winter seems to be dying. Purchasing a old digital camera for better photos. This is what today feels like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d2Vy6wnxFY

There is a class of women that I cant quite come to a definition for. I can now after much practice, in some strange way feel these women's expressions, reactions, and inability to hold themselves in any sort of regulatory emotional framework. It can also be stated that most have been victim to their actions and its destructive power on relationships yet they persist in this destructive force as though it is life giving. I then envision the decades of neurosis awaiting the suitor this class of women chooses, constant and dull pain of dealing with this type of women will inevitably lead many men to alternative forms of life satisfaction depending typically on temperament. The same goes for men as well, but as a man it is much easier to avoid the men than the women due to the forces of nature.  It is critical for a man to study women and their actions irrational as they may seem to an uneducated man. Because to fulfill a lifetime of satisfaction with the opposite sex requires like most grand pursuits, a great deal of pain, growing and education. And to define women purely in terms of irrationality makes one an easier target for its destruction. Although this definition fits for the ladder class of women it so too fits for that same class of men, who see women from a unidimensional viewpoint in terms of their decision making. One who is educated should see the complexity of this class of decision makers and pick up on the ques that are given when communicating. Once trained in this recognition of temperament, man or women, it should be advised to stay a safe distance, and if needing to communicate do so with caution in every word to protect oneself against an attack be it socially, emotionally or physically.

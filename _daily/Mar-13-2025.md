Slept way more than I should after work, Sleeping pattern is such a mess.

Music is the best thing humans ever found. It is a form of art that unlike other form do to its potency and package. In 2 minutes you can be bathing in new waves on consciousness, no person I know around me can grab me or pull pleasure from inside me like music can, only the idea of a person from the perspective of a musical piece can hold me just by its existence, an existence only in my head, something that I feel is not exactly healthy. I see a form of you when I hear music, and I know that will make me disappointed in the real you.

# Mar-01-2025

If you need more than 10 even 15 million dollars in 2025 to be comfortable or live a meaningful life in addition to not worrying about money, (M)oney has you by the balls, and your materialism will see to it that 15 billion wont suffice.

I can tell when someone will age poorly just based on physiognomic features like skin-type, jaw shape, cheek shape, eye shape, etc. The same features that present themselves in those who age worse also present themselves in the lower strata of income and intelligence, its funny how poor and stupid people just get walloped at every turn. I guess its the punishment for causing much of the worlds problems.

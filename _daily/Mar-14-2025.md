Another somewhat nice spring day. Winter seems to be dying. Purchasing a old digital camera for better photos. This is today feels like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d2Vy6wnxFY

The thing I see in many women is hard to put into words. I can in some way see a women's expression and derive a decade or two of neurosis awaiting the suitor she chooses, constant and dull pain of dealing with this type of women will inevitably lead many men to alternative forms of life satisfaction depending typically on temperament. It is critical for a man to study women and their actions irrational as they may seem to the unknowing man, because to fulfill a lifetime of just satisfaction with a women requires like most truthful pursuits of meaning a great deal of pain, growing and education. And to define women in terms of irrationality is leading you more into the trap. Although this definition fits for a class of women it so too fits for that same class of men. One who is educated should above all else study these classes, stay quite a distance, and if needing to communicate do so as truthfully and quickly as possible to protect oneself against an attack be it socially, emotionally or physically.

Neurosis is worn on the face, in its movement and subtle features, the dropping smile, certain underused or overused facial muscles are an indication to me that you and to a lesser extent your family lineage is perhaps the neurotic kind, the gas station kind, the looping in back on its own hell kind, the never able to escape natures caste kind, the kind I stay away from. It's ok to stay away from people for the way they look. Do it and see how much your life improves, if you dont like people who are always frowning, good, thats something telling you to do that, listen to it, make them change there frown. All this is a form of physiognomic pattern recognition, the intelligent pupil is better at this pattern recognition and then maps the small patterns to the larger patterns, the smile to the actions. These patterns fractals over grand timeframes to produce a clue, an isight into why some people sit at gas stations and why some conquer nations.

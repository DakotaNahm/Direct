Buffalo seemed to have taken an interest in the current rioting meta. I can see both sides ends of this sword. The modern world has people angry and the cities seem to be the epicenter of this anger. Those in the country just deploy our typically drunken anger on loved ones in the grey, live laugh love bedroom of the ghastly doublewide shitbox as is tradition. The drive home was rather nice though. Windmills are a farmers best friend.

being 18 and white my opinion serves very little on these matters.

# Nov-14-2020 - Status

If your motivation does not align to your work ethic it isn't motivation. Motivation is a buzz word prescribed to bursts of dopamine, something a lower status[^1] depressed person craves as all humans do but very much in the depressed individual. A better place to be would be a high serotonin state caused by higher status, where working in a state of non motivation is not a chore. Motivation is used to sell books and market products, those who are low on the human hierarchy will always complain of lack of motivation, it comes part and parcel of those on the lower rungs. The latter keeps generations left in the dust of those who's forefathers established themselves as superior. Those who are higher on this hierarchy deem it not a chore but a privilege and are glad to work. It is only a chore when you lack appreciation. Depressed lower status individuals seldom experience the intensity or posterity that gratitude for good work does. It should be noted that work and money are two separate things, not all rich people inhibit these higher human statuses, it is just that you find that higher status individual tend to be wealthy because they attract this wealth through status and gratitude to be able to work. This wheel of the lower classes becoming lower and higher classes becoming higher seems to be growing but not at the rate that is demonstrated in media. It is also a difficult task to tell an individuals status purely off income or material. It is better to act as though the person you are talking to belongs to all statuses, until revealed through action and words which typically reveals itself quickly. Intelligence plays a crucial role from my estimates at how far someone can understand there status. 

[^1]: Status does not mean high wealth, large family, many friends, or even intelligence. It is the ability to pursue action to make good, and feel appreciation that you are able to do this. Those who are high in this status naturally attract friends, families and wealth. Those who are born into these things tend to have the genetic makeup of someone who has this status and thus this status will propagate. However these things can fade after a few generations of questionable partners and lack of responsibility.

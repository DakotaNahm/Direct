One person is a fit, 2 people is a fight.

The news Jews, don't let them hear that. I do not follow any form of anti-Semitism not based in the preservation of the well-being of all humans. But I deny any religion or group of people who treats others as though they are cattle. I also deny the ideas of intellectuals who use there power to introduce ideologies whos axioms have been proven destructive. All ideologies can be destructive, but the ideologies posited by intellectual Jews (and also Catholics to some degree) tend to create mass divisions and social upheaval for no return. It must be stated that I do not detest Jews. I imagine based on my lineage I am Jewish to some extent. The Jews that I have met have been lovely people, the problem lies in that there are large sects of Jews that would want nothing to do with me or any other non-Jew, a somewhat tribal view of people and the world that does nothing to help their reputation. I must reiterate this does not apply to Jews as a whole, I have admiration for Jews and there plight, but as stated before I cannot admire those Jews who would if given the opportunity would destroy all my systems of value and treat me as sub-human. This is not anti-Semitic, its pro-human.

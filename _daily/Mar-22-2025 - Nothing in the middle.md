# Mar-22-2025 - Nothing in the middle

One should never strive for the middle. The middle life, the nothing middle is 

Middle life is
- office work
- much of blue collar America

The janitor, the low class p

I hear stories about electricians keeping lights on, firefighters, those blue collar in the middle. It is the roll of every man to educate himself in the functioning of his home and its repair. 

This nurturing and coddling of the middle, the “people who keep the lights on” mentality keeps people weak, in a form of my job is so important how can I possibly improve. Most of America and its people can reach personal self sufficiency.

The tradesmen are of no good stock, so too the engineers. These people are looking nowhere when working but in the wallet and this creates work that does nothing more but create more work. Then it is customary to praise these people like saints for “keeping the lights on”. 

A dedicated tradesmen or craftsmen deserves praise but they are like most dedicated people in the modern world few and far between.

They are looking again just too a paycheck, they wire like mad the tinder box condo that pervades the term “new construction”. The builder the electrician has no power they listen to a customer which is 

For if he sit too long he is torn.

The morality and sainthood of these people is in direct correlation with the flaws of the modern world. These people are not moral for wanting a paycheck and should not be touted as heroes for fixing poles. It is the case I imagine that if a large sum of these men were to receive a hefty inheritance their idea of themselves would change as would there occupation. They are controlled by the money they desire and because they let people watch sports by hooking up power to a TV they are deemed virtuous. This virtue places in these individuals then creates abdication for those not pursuing 'keeping the lights on'. The keeping the lights on works only for the interest of the business, not the individual. This virtue placed upon these people is not a lifting force but a lowering force. The fact they are not paid the same as a businessman and are touted as hero's for taking such wages for keeping the world 'spinning' shows an accepted weakness inside them. The blue collar serf values weakness and obedience. Those who actually dominate the environment are in charge of these people and use society to prop them up to a higher sudo-status in the aim to keep them working longer and harder to keep businesses running. While anyone who is willing to learn can do most of their work or disregard their service entirely.

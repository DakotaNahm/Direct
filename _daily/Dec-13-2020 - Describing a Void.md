# Dec-13-2020 - Describing a Void

I become aggravated as I write. My experiences are chained by words. For instance, there is a prevailing feeling of what can only be described as a void around me at all times. It feels as though any moment I shall slip out of this reality into an infinite nothingness, as though all moments of all days are right on the edge of this infinity, and I am powerless to move away. This void is all consuming in bad times and manageable in good. Never have I heard of anyone else describe this, an almost interdimensional feeling of a parallel world ready to consume you at any point. And no description I give can brings it closer to understanding.

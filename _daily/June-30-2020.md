# June-30-2020

Today was a great day, Lake Erie's water feels very nice on my skin. There is very little that can match a good swim with friends. As clich√© as it is, it brings me back to bathing in a creek when the electric company used to turn our electricity and water off. During that time my brothers and I didn't seem to care we had no power.

Here are some poor photos from today.

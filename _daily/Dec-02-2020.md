I heard a person refer to covid-19 as "covert-naan-teen". 


I feel I owe my superiors way more than they disserve. I have a drive to please these people that have no interest in being pleased unless monetary gain is involved. The question should then be asked, Is it healthy to want to please people who show no please towards you or who you are? The answer to most would seem no, but if they are your superior what choice do you have? You can commit yourself to lack luster performance and hope no consequences come of it or find new employment, I would rather create my own employment and hold myself to the same standards.

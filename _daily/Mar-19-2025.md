Nicotine is a wonder drug, I cant imagine my life without it. Driving paired with nicotine can cure most things. I notice in myself a-lot of anger for my ex-girlfriend. I dont know where it is boinging up from but I feel intense anger towards her and her ways and what she pursues. Today was too nice a day to have anger fill it.

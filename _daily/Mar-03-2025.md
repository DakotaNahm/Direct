Sufferings necessity reveals itself as the truth of experience in destroying the framework inside you that will become your life's quest is to re-instantiate from a grand perspective, not grand in terms of scope necessarily although it will have grown, but grand in terms of action. If you do not do this nothing substantial will happen. It is the case however that most crave the feeble but inviting arms of the latter. You cannot feel all your being without the ripping and tearing of your internal fabric that shields your full self. Suffering, danger, lacking stimulus and desires are all ways to tear this fabric to expose the naked all you.

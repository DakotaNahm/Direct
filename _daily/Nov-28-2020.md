# Nov-28-2020


It's my birthday today. My family is so hidden from reality. I wonder if they have goals, they don't seem to which fills me with dread. I cannot look to them with much in the way of desire to achieve, they are TV people. 

I need to finish projects I start. I could not sit down and finish that drawing of the forest while hunting, I lost focus.

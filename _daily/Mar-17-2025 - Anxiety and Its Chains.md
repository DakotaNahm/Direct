# Mar-17-2025 - Anxiety and Its Chains


Anxiety is a creator chains. both heavy and seemingly unbreakable. These chains connect people to ideas, places, other people. They do no less to slow down humanity than the mentally retarded. I can remember the onset of my fate. I must have been around 7 years old, this was the first time I experienced this dread, this weight, a void I have no idea existed but was my destiny to contend with for every single second of every single day until I am wiped from this earth. A weakening of muscles, a destroyer of neurons. I detest my mother and her genealogy, she knows nothing but love from me, but deep inside is a fierce drive to wipe that lineage and its pathogen from this earth. There is no worse fate than the truly anxious, the true neurotic. The blind see more beauty than the hapless anxious, for all paths lead back to the cause of the seeking in the first place, the inability to escape the void bestowed by there own nature. True anxiety, the kind there seems no cure for will thrive in cracks and crevasses societies make by accident. No truly anxious person will ever see success in there lives, they have been cursed to carry these chains and being to preoccupied with there own illness they will never provide the feedback necessary to create meaning from this act of carrying. Being in this way is hell. Drag and drag each day they drag, the chains drag but this continual act builds no strength. The opposite is true, your body wears and shakes, while the strong grow to contend with realities, play games, and win. Anxiety and its chains will torment those who are forced to carry them until their days are over, and that will not be a pleasant day for the anxious person, it will be the day they know god does not like all its creations equally. I write because I'm anxious, I do just about all tasks because of the all prevailing nature of anxiety. I wish to prove what I have written wrong, to come back to this and laugh at its words.

# Mar-17-2025 - Anxiety and Its Chains


Anxiety is a creator chains. both heavy and seemingly unbreakable. These chains connect people to ideas, places, other people. Anxiety does no less to slow down humanity than the mentally retarded. A weakening of muscles, a destroyer of neurons. I detest my mother and her genealogy, she knows nothing but love from me, but deep inside is a fierce drive to wipe that lineage and its pathogen from this earth. There is no worse fate than the truly anxious, the true neurotic. True anxiety, the kind there seems no cure for will thrive in. Being in this way is hell. Drag and drag each day they drag, the chains drag but this continual act builds no strength. The opposite is true, your body wears and shakes, while the strong grow to contend with realities, play games, and win. True Anxiety and its chains will torment those who are forced to carry them until their days are over, and that will not be a pleasant day for the anxious person, it will be the day they realize god does not like all its creations equally, because even at death those weights are present. Some were given through nature or upbringing to be able to carry such weights, others were given the luxury of not feeling a weight in the first place. This is where the truly anxious is differentiated from the latter, they are hyper aware of this weight and the all consuming void that presents itself when the weight is too much to bear.

Levels of consciousness. We all slip between and work towards consciousnesses. These are the three that seem to be represented in modern consciousness .

1). Slave Consciousness

	- Women
	- Drugs
	- useless work for wage
	- non oriented Ideas
	- Emotions
	- Low connective or constilitory ability
	- Small field of view


2).Work/Art Consciousness [^1]

	- Goal Oriented
	- Goal aligns with highest good
	- Goal is in the name of beauty and creation
	- Work that produces value
	- Growing field of view

3). Child Consciousness

	- Closest to god
	- Need no creation other than what is created
	- Very hard to attain
	- Goal orientation is pure experience[^2]
	- Large field of view

[^1]: Those who are within slave consciousness can seem to be in work/art conc. This is nothing more than a fa√ßade and a mighty common one. They are oriented to no good, they are busy idiots to use the words of Gordan Ramsey.

[^2]: The child consciousness is still a working mind but the orientation is purely on the creator, nothing more. The child consciousness does not care about your drum kits on Ableton.

# Mar-05-2025

I like the concept of the last time you will touch or hold an object you will likely never touch or hold again. For instance I saw a low quality png of a paper ninja star and it made me think there was a last time I touched one of these things and never thought it would be the last time, this happens every day and we dont pay mind because most objects we touch dont hold this very specific type of significance. The items that strike deepest to the core of this phenomenon are typically childhood and adolescent items which had very little useful significance however where used in some form of playful banter. These items over many years become dusty memories, items like funny erasers, or penis sketching markers. I hold these items as the banter of my child and they are good things inside me.

I like the concept of the last time you will touch or hold an object you will likely never touch or hold again. For instance I saw a low quality png of a paper ninja star and it made me think there was a last time I touched one of these things and never thought it would be the last time, this happens every day and we don't pay mind because most objects we touch do not hold this very specific type of significance. The items that strike deepest to the core of this phenomenon are typically childhood or adolescent items which had very little useful significance however where used in some form of playful banter. These items over many years become dusty memories, items like funny erasers, or penis sketching markers.

Modern car dimensions are absurd. There is no such thing as a small car. The small car is dead, and replaced by the 'compact'. This trend seems to have arisen in the 2010s and continues to widen and extend everything it can get its hands on. Manufactures use 'safety' and new tech as this excuse. There is no amount of safety that will prevent a tractor trailer drifting into your lane, the length only gives it more area to hit. And the new 'tech' is what I call 'tesla-tech', fart noises and funny screens; unneeded clutter. Here are some examples of the lengthening over the past decade or so.

Honda Accord {2005 Length: 187.6", 2025 Length: 195.7" } = Increase of 8 Inches in length
Toyota Corolla {2005 Length: 178.3″, 2025 Length: 182.5″} = Increase of 4 Inches
Toyota Camry {2005 Length: 189.2″, 2025 Length: 193.5″} = Increase of 4 Inches
Ford Ranger {2005 Length: 190", 2025 Length: 210"} = Increase of about 20 inches
Rav4 {2005 Length: 166", 2025 Length: 180.9"} = Increase of 14.9 Inches


I understand you don't want you family to be crushed so add more airbags and crumple zones, but that doesn't mean take out every small car from every lineup.

# Mar-21-2025 - Financial Freedom

The goal of financial freedom is to relinquish money as a energy store concept. To know you have enough to live and continue living without looking is the first step of this form of freedom. The second step is to adopt a somewhat anti-materialist view on life. The materialist will spend his wealth on extravagance, but the intelligent person will use wealth in the direct opposite way. This freedom should ironically give the beneficiary the ability to NOT buy things, to not pay interest on a mortgage, to not pay credit cards, having abundance grants you the ability to create more abundance via the lack of spending. Having large amounts of wealth grants one time, which seems to be the greatest of all assets. The intelligent will use this time for study, work, creation and to be in service of those around you. Being financially free is a burden that only those meant to be free can handle, many who gain large amounts of wealth will be buried in their own shadow. Obtaining wealth is antithetical to obtaining freedom. Freedom takes a deep understanding of the self, while obtaining wealth without knowing the self will leave that wealth to fall prey to unknown voids within that individual. Wealth should allow the individual time to come to terms with how daunting a task true freedom is and that the wealth can so easily destroy the bearer. For freedom you must be responsible, you must pursue the mastering of the self, and in doing so master the world around the self. If you do not, that wealth will turn to comfort and eventually slavery. The more money falls into the hands of those with this type of freedom, the better that money is used.

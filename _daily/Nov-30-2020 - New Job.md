# Nov-30-2020 - New Job

Today was my first day at a new job. It seems easy, but the overarching feeling that made me flee from my previous job is starting to creep up on me. It's a feeling of entrapment almost. I feel as though I am stuckÂ and not moving, a slave to someone or some entity. It makes me miss my previous warehouse job, its high pace and body punishing work made it quite rewarding at the end of the day. To those not blessed enough to do manual labor I pity, using your body for a collective goal is something every human should experience.

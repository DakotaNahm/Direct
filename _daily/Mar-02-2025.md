Very Cold. Winter fighting, want sun.



**Methodology of making unique art via sleep patterns**

Unique sleep and wake is a burden on your body and on your mind, but lack of sleep or disruption of deep sleep does do something quite strange. Much like drugs or alcohol, it breaks down a barrier,  a subconscious barrier your brain is too tired to keep up. I commit myself 1 day a week to sleep deprivation of waking in the middle of the night and forcing myself awake. This unlocks worlds and insights I would have never came to with a sober, rested brain. My drug to alter consciousness isn't a drug at all but a high-jacking of the brains strange systems during the sleep/wake liminality period most sleep through.

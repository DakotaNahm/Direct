# Mar-07-2025

Went to the ER last night. The night tremors got unbearable, I was terrified I wasn't going to be able to move normally. it was a good thing I went, had dangerously low potassium levels, could have been worse. My health issues don't seem to ever go away, they just seem to mutate into different issues and continually devastate me every few months.

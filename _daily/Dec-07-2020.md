It surprises me very much how often I seem to come across someone with a creative passion, open-expansive mind, or just passion for the unusual. It seems however that most creatives cannot captivate a large audience. Should you want to captivate a large audience as an artist? Is there art so good it captures such a broad range of humans there is no need to direct this art at a culture of people? What is there to be said about art that has no viewers? Do you want your message to apply to the masses? I believe a good artist can in some ways lay out their art for both the layman and the intellectual critic, spanning across the range of human awareness's, the entire bell curve. Very few artists can achieve this feat.

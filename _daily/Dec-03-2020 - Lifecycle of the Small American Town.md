# Dec-03-2020 - Lifecycle of the Small American Town

Many of the local shit-sacks that claim dominance over the business and politics of a small American town do so due to boomer idealization of its coevals. Most small town businesses are nepotistic in nature (for good reason),  but are owned by beat down drags. These men destroy a small town by churning out more clandestine queers who will inherit both the business and the drinking problem. The small towns will overrun with the breed of these people who propagate like rabbits with the other popular surnames to remain dominant. This mass of doppelgangers then go on spend most of their evenings practicing the art of whole-lotta-nothing at the local watering hole where. This is the life cycle of the small American town. There is no power in what they do, they fill their little lives with as much as they can before their livers fail.

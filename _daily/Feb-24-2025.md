learning to write is the best thing a human can do. Language forces us to think in terms of language which seems to not be the inherit human communication method, so to master language and writing is to master a mode of thinking. Learning how to think very well in terms of language also gives you a framework on how to learn to think and communicate in other forms of communication like the body and symbols. The reverse can also be true, the more you master symbols and the body the better a writer you will become.

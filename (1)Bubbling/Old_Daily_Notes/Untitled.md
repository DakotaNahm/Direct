- 21 Years old is a critical turning point on peoples lives, not  25 or even 30, I would argue 21 is greater than all of those, its the fondational
year that all 5 year intervals from that point on will rest. Choose what you learn and who you learn with carefully at 21

- "they say I fell off, ohh I needed that".
- I am grateful so greatful for my fall, I look back on the last 5 years with nothing but honor and joy to the fact it took place. I failed. And that
fills me now with so much joy, I see the lives of those who have not gone out in the world and pursued something great, have not failed and learned deep generational lessons, they
will never pull there ansestors from the pits they lay in, they will never achieve true greatness. People need to fall off, its the only
form that can train the child out of the adult and then put the child back into the adult in harmony. I truly beleive this. This points to my essay on Adultsitm, this does not happen to a person who was 
infected with adultism. They are lacking in basic virtue. To gain such virtue is a long argous, but beautiful prcoess much like raising a child, The adultist seldom goes through the (w)hole
process they go thorugh minor steps such as a dependence on a drug, a midlife crisis, a switching of a trivial vocation. One must get to the point wehre these things
are not questions and do not alter the fondation you stand on, a fondation only great people can stand on. they cannot shake my fondation
now, it would be impossible. This stregnth from seeing the hell taken place before me has created a bright shine on my metal, it has cleansed genorations of rust. Someone long ago
is cheering for me now, keep cheering, im just getting started.

- i got hooked at finding mmid-western us obituraries, they seemingly are on the surface quite mundane but their interests and family structures provide insight into many things in the trends and living of these people,
its strange how each of there lives have conneceting zettelkasten like queltities, or it could be the shitty writing of the obituary survice. Here is one I found I found intereging, there is ment to be nothing
but repsect for this person and his families.In no way am I trashing these people, its just intreuuging to think about there lives and connect them to others
in the eara, creating sort of a map of the area in my head. https://www.eastgatefuneral.com/obituaries/christopher-salter.

- The hardening of the person after the fertility stage is not a linear path, for the average person hardens much more than someone on the higher end of “openness”. It’s exponentioal in the opposite direction in regards to “openness” and to a lesser degree intelligence.

- God strips away all that is beauty in humans, for this ive heard many reasons as to why, but what I have not heard asked is, why so little time, the debt of failure allows very few to procude and admire this short beauty in the modern world, I ask god why so short. Why only 2X-3X years, why not 100 years of beautiful creation. Is it lust?

- Come on man, you really think this shit is slowing down! Its speeding up, at a foroucious rate. The daily formula turns once exiting people into hardened balls of playdoe left under a kids bed until found 5 years later, at which point it has the same form it had been shaped to all those years ago exepect dry and cracking, covered in debris and age. The child now more grown and forgetfull of the shape it was trying to make that ball all those years ago scoffs at its grosness but not that hard can be used in some way againt a bat or some other shattering event. I fear this happening to me and also more afraid is the idea that to combat this is almost insurmountable to become adult. Time is hell, human is hell, there is no ordained godliness to the idea of the people I see. I vomit with enxiety at there sight, just a little taste to the future.

- 1994 seems like it was sort of the pinnacale of modern design and forms.
- The purpose of the internet is a large game, figure out as many nooks and crannys in the internet as possible, ride it, figure out its ideosicicies and customs, Find where its going, and how it will get there, use it to your advantage,  tame it to your desires, once accomplished you can leave the internet, you have won. It will change without you, but you now understand its purpose and all iterations within that purpose will in essance fullfill the same goal just in a different format. The internet is now a trophy, a home, to you not a forrest. Only the truly pure of heart and stone of mind can get to such a point. Its under your control, its in your grasp, most will get mesmorized and madussad by its madness, never attempting and wash themsleves in the most midwit of internet desires, these are your minds for the taking, but in doing so trials that lay ahead are tough and harsh to the neurotic mind. If you have what it takes to slay the net dragon; go for it, the gold is immence, and you will see once you get there, you never needed the gold, you wanted the knowledge, the wisdom and power the internet holds.

- The 90's, 2000's ambient electronic genre was jungle and drum and bass, the 2010's had vaporwave and all its darivations. what does the 2020's have?
- There is in everyone of us something hunting the good, plotting a move and thinking ahead to surmount the potential of you. A demon everyone feels but doesnt see, Do not think of yourself as something that is ending or achiveable, think of yourself as a game and your oppenent is something that you must plan ahead and defeat, sadly this enemy is inborn and anceint, it will never die, but you can make it work not only for you but become so good that its presence is no longer a viable solution, its a reminder of your human. Win the game today, and next week and next year, become undefeatable. My shoe was sitting next to a heater, and when i lifted my shoe up it touched the bare skin on my leg and it felt like hitting the side of a cars body on a hot summer day, it felt good to be burnt.

- Jungle and drum and bass are a superior form of music that is making a comeback. The reason for its resilience and revilitization is its quality to pair quite well in the person working at a pace and whos neuurons fire at steady, fast intervals much like the music.

- Spiritual truth in so much that it is not questionable or negotaible is the missing fondation that seperates class sturcutre in hyper-capitalist societies. Lower IQ individals can not and will not individaute against the heard since they do not feel a part of a grand heard of can conceive of such things. Spiritual groundwork is an answer to leveling a feild at least on one aspect of the human. Neitsches works on individuation leave out the idea that some are purley not capable to conceive of themselves in a individuaistc way, that is where Julian Evola's traditional theory of the spiritual at the top of the heirachy does its justice.

- Trump, his family, his followers and nuances of a new era of nothingness. The sudo-riviilzation of the right in my estimation is a ploy to increase the capitalist machine, The shifting to the left that the right has been made to do to be in competition makes it non-right and non spiritual. The 'right' now is a capitalist sudo-right, intrenched in half-handed traditions and lofty tech goals. Many would arguue this beats the woke left and I would agree, but it is just stepping into the traingle of politics in an individualst heirachy much like nick land has predicted, and if his prediction succedd the tech-bro right will have an enlightement period followed by a Kali-Yuga period of sorts in the coming decades, they will be thrown into spiritual tourment following the totalization of the capitalist system in the hands of immerging complete tech or all incompasing technology that leaves there tech-intellectualism grasping for strings, only those like the trump family will emerge with the "CEO" level of power leaving the tech-bro to be a subticant of there desires and what the capitalist system deems tradition and good, a traditional heirachy with profit at the center not the human. A metaphysical feeling, described only as disingous spirit of a destructive narrative is what i feel. I stare at this picture and do not see those who have faught the war to become themselves the war they fight is keeping themslves in a double false image, one image false from birth, the other image the fake individualized. Many of the leaders in todays twitter tech sphere were born into the tech, father tech owners, etc. Never in the woods, never truly human. And they will pay dearly for this, the sentiment of money and power will not tire on these people and they will be as Evola called non-human. This however seems to be just another step in the hegalian ending of the human race, another mistake that will prodcue 99% bad, but 1% good, and 1% is better than the left has done. I guess the point im trying to make it read philopshy, test your body and be in good art. Suffer. This is the only way you can be at there level. They look down on you, tech-bro hypercapitalists, elon musk, donald trump look down on you, not as a god but as a ruler, and not a spiritual ruler but as a tool. They sell you narratives of the spirit in exchange for the capital. The kings of older times if a proper king looked at his people not as pawns but as a collective spirit that guided the progression of the kingdom, Elon and Trump do not look at you like this unless they can use you then they will give yout the impression, they are for complete power, which is unlikly. I am right wing, I like traditional right wing, not the sudo-techbro- right wing bullshit. Then the question arises, why did this system disipear, if it was that good it would have stayed. I am trying to figure that out myself. But as pointed out these things these waaves of common sudo-right euphira seen on twitter are collective comoferting of the right leaning mind who has seen trash for too long, but replaced in the trashes absence is benevolence and anti-self actualization. The 1950s are over chud.

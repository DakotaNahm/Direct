# Work is Life

Work is life, the Aethet knows this, 

This work is just at oppostion to hedonism
Hedonism in this case takes many forms
You should work every day of your life and it should feel as though you are not.

Things to Avoid
- Drugs / Alchol
- sex without commitment or intent.
- too much money
- Non-contstructive media
- masterbation
- caffeiene
- un-needed stress.

Things that are work both large and small
- Enjoying nature large and small
- Writing
- The Arts
- teaching the youth
- cleaning your house
- practising religion and praising god.
- Abstience
- responsibilites to family
- responsibilites to community
- reading
- working out
- healthy eating
- strict schedule

You can channel sexual and lustful energy into creative passions with much better results, There was a women i wass and still am infuated with, Her beauty is striking in a non-traditional sence, seeing someone that looks 80% to her givese me the same feeling. Instead of texting and begging for her touch I use her image and memeory as a spark to put into music. After a while you realize the sexual, lustful nature of the idea has dwindled and all that is left is admiration for god and its beauty, it was gods ability to create such bbeauty, the idea that in this world that something so beautiful exists and is in motion is a testiment to natures virtue. If given the chance I would most likely not want to have sex with her, I do not want to change the image of her becuase it has given me so much, like a painting.

All these and much more and work, but that work is great work, great work will result in great things
nothing more.

God is all thigns and is all good and does not punish, it teaches, its your goal to work and learn.

Money and its use cases
- Money should provide a fondation, its should provide a place to  live and make great,
a place to work hopefully raise children.
- paying Zakat, this is very complex, more complex than the muslims make it to be, paying Zakat can become nonsence if the money goes to those in the grips of something that results in exponentiation of  downward spiritual movement, Zakat should be controlled by the individual. An example of how I use it is this, a checklist.
If i have 2,000$ to give away, i will go through a list of people I know need it more than I, and then will buy them specific items after understanding there places. For instance a freind needed money for a car, but I would not give him 2000$ for a car, instead I gave him the ability to save for a car by sparsing out small payments for items he "thought" he needed, only giving money to things he did need, food, electric, etc. But never saying much much I would give him, just giving me "breathinig room" so the building up to purchase a car was realistic, its a teaching mechanism, buying the car outright would then allow that person to get back in the same spot that brought them to lacking one in the first place, but now that person is using there own money which they saved by working to buy the car, with a coushon from me to be able to save and think of other ways of aquiring money for the car. Now that car is something special it is there work in action. And if they dont save or work towards a car then they truly never wanted or needed one.


Be very aware of the subtlety of concious awareness to a degreee which borders on metaphysical experiencce in the face of slight changes in sensory input. For example, a smell to most brings a memory, but to those with this awareness of what a smell is, is possibilites and directions in time. Meaning the ssmell causses a feeling asa though you are not only back in your time, but someone and somwhere elses. If done correctly, if enough time and effort iss given to the education of your sspirit to intake input in ssusch wayss it can be almost a ssexual experience to smell certain sssmellsss, and to feel certain things, or to heart certain mussic, the same pathwayss in my estimation woudl light up and more. This subtle Sensibility in my estimation stems from the idea of a suffering first stimulus follows mindset, in so much as if you bear suffering, work intesnly, live intenslty, you will not need NFL games to get a rush, the mear wind of spring gives you a transindental experience.

Madame Blavatsky has caused more harm to the modern women then any other women in history.

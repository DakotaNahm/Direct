# Mountain Monsters v Game of Thrones


The transidental greatness of Cryptozology Reality TV

The order of realism is spectrum, but each comes with its own set of 
Mountain Monsters
Ghost Adventures
River Monsters
Monster Quest
Finding Bigfoot
Planet Earth
Steve Erwin
Anthony Bourdain No Reservation
90s Goosebumps
Lost Tapes
-----------------------
Pawn Stars
Auctiion Wars
Hardcore Pawn
Bar Rescue
Extreme Cheapscapes
First 48
cash cab
Count Customs


These shows are aligned on both an X and a Y spectrum indiicated by realism, shot selection and overall planning. Shark week fits somehwat snug but not actually capturuing this alllure to its ffuullest extent. Ancient Aliens is played out with little in the way of action.

The Bell curve in action. These shows are the true story tellers, the beleivers and enjorers at each end. In the midddle, the reddit skeptic, thhe game of thrones enjoyer. Mountain Monsters is better than game of thrones. An electric feeling as these shows were paramount to the youung appiilcation tantro. These forces are the greek story tellers realized.

The complexity and hyper sexualization in shows like game of thrones andd to a lesser extent breaking bad are viruses in my opinion, the striving human will come in contact with much of the same symptoms these shows rely on for entertainment, you can live thhhese shows, bbut thhe true stories are made on late 2000s reality tv shows. They were a drama, like WWE bbut better, thhis is what TV was ment for, not an investment of tiime and reasources to understand a narrative, but to sit and enjoy the false but more true thhan any game off thrones epiisode look into the soul drive of humans, child like wondderment off the natural worldd.

The unending curiousiity that accompanies these shows is the steak through the game of throwns heart, no hand holdding, pure experiencing a story, fake or  not. Fake is more real then real.

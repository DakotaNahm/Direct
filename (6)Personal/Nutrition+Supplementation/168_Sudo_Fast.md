# 16:8_Sudo_Fast

### Alternative 16:8 method
This is my method that seems to work best for me. The main difference is that in the morning I like to have a shake, kefir or coffee to have something in my stomach  before working out and taking supplements. This in some people breaks the fast but it is merely a stomach coating, this was quite normal for a farmer to have a glass of milk in the morning before work to help deal with any stomach ailments. The remaining of the fast remains the same. I do not eat until around 5pm. This simple fasting method has allowed more laser focus both during the day and night, it allows you to go to bed with a full stomach and also time bowel movements.

Echo Radio

- ( Its just some stories )
- A Radio-station represents sitting in the car looking outside and seeing the world like a child through the window. It’s Like Listening to a radio station like a kid in the car.
- Its meant to be that some of the best times of his life is listening to the radio, just being in a car, moving nothing more… Just that movement from one place to another, its liminal in a sense. And the echos of that are presented today and sort of what he is searching for.

GUNS

Songs about money

About the ways that people are cheap and see no issues with it, feed him gas station his brain need it. People feeding their children gas station food, Appalachia and the rust belt is a poor area, and this sentiment was realized in this song, when he gets the money,  he doesn’t need to money, money doesn’t make him happy, he was happy without it, it’s only comparing that makes you unhappy and it gives you a way to be healthy.

I am living in my car, these things are being made from my car. When we was making this, he was going to a local studio and sleeping in his car, basically he was homeless.

Touring

- 1 Tour ( 2026 )
- Music festivals ( 2027 )
- Drop off the earth, I’m focusing more on what makes me feel good and want to wake up, and touring isn’t it. I like to be with my friends, I’m starting a candle business, 

  

First part talks about

- fun but being given bad advice, seeing domestic abuse, playing around, not being good. He begins loosing touch with his freinds and people in his community, he wants to be something more but doesn’t even know if that exists, all he sees is grey. Homelessness, gun threatening. Meth heads, drunks

  

- Second. Running around aimlessly, finally out of anxiety he settles down and has a kid. Trying to settle down, it feels good for a little while but it doesn’t last, he felt pressured and begins to fall into depression and drinking. He looses 

  

- are some men ment to

  

- for the system to work, many must fail.

  

- pressures an expectations to suffer ceaselessly

  

- a major loss

  

- “are you stupid, no… then why the fuck are you acting stupid, when the fuck are you gonna grow up” your drunk

Immortal lust

  

Each Album has a secret sound that sort of blends into songs. A little beep or something.

  

I don’t really have a story, so it’s kind of tough, maybe its repression, don’t really know. Cut grass don’t smell no more. Cant fall asleep now, makes me violent. My only solace is sleep. Not really cool. 

Do you hear me?

Do you hear me?

Do you hear me?

I don’t have a story, not many people do, we are just visitors, then we go. Will a story make it better, even a bad one? Will it make the wrinkles worth while? Even the deep ones? Will it make the time feel worth it? Even the hard ones? 

  

Not the same birds but they make the same sounds, 

Rare birds are hard, but hear there song and don’t forget it, because the crows will yell loud when that’s all you have.

Kendrick Lamar - Pride

- sinking

“And that’s the great con of life—-to feel alive—-to realize it’s all a clock that counts demise—-to see yourself floating with your head held high, once you see the dark below you, you can’t float or you die.”

  

“And it’s easy to swim, swim, swim, when the floaties have been tied tight, but you will find one day, that the air has gone by, and the time is now passing, muscles start to cramp, cramp, cramp. The sharks are now swimming and you can’t help but look in the past”

  

“Now your sinking in those feelings, of the life that flies by, don’t look now or you’ll miss it, it’s time to run wild”

  

“You’ll see money, kids and luxury to quell the darkness that lives under, but is it all trick for that sinking feeling to be plundered”

  

“Was that as good as it gets, is it all underwater from here, just keep your head up a little longer, maybe that lifeboat will appear”

  

“Dont remember this on me.”

  

Thank you for existing.

Hard lessons through soft living

  

Bad ground

- prime is history
- Connections made, bad ground
- Connections lost, bad ground 
- Surging foreward 
- I promise this isn’t me, I wasn’t always like this you see. 
- Strokes of luck, arching at me
- Fading fast
- You see I wasn’t always like this
- Shaking under me, what I’ve built is crumbling,
- Foundation shook.
- What a little world we had, grew a little fast now it’s 

  

When I get home from seeing them, it always makes me feel a little down, blue bodies around the bend, potential lost, can’t see gain

GUNS

  

_‘I Liked being nothing With you’_

  

GUNS

Changes depending on where you are in life

When you are happy it feels this way, when you are sad it feels this way

Much like a GUNS can save you or kill you… Its a double edged sword.

  

  

  

GUNS is an existential, romantic Masterpiece, nostalgic, dense masterpiece about growing up and seeing things. He questions wether it was his childhood that got him this far deep? Or Wether he was always meant to be here, maybe that’s why his grandfather did what he did… Maybe its destiny.

  

GUNS is a set of stories through what seems to be multiple peoples lives as they grow older. It’s broken up into 4 sections, each with a narrative focus, it could have something to do with the 4 stages of the Buddhist life, or a person looking back at their life, it’s strange, the timeline can be flipped, it can start forwards or backwards, the song writing makes this so.

  

sensory pleasure and universal meaning

  

Synth country song, change something about country, take it and flip it on its head. It’s about how the small town life only works with experience, people will inevitably feel trapped by such a life, it’s just in nature. It’s a ode to bad shit

  

  

More Pricks than kicks.

  

Elvis voice before song

“Hit, now me, whip me stick me, you know, wwweeewww people scream”

  

Jealousy only

Lyrics

- I Lack nothing… I Lack nothing
- I am scared to feel good.
- Wife Shaped Loneliness, Push that ole dog, her bones hurt, her times coming soon.
- You fear it, we fear it, identical days
- Face flat, cannot change that.
- Your are ineffable
- Sante Fe Burger
- Sell it for the price of labor
- Bananas taste better in the summer, burp up pepper, pasta salad and dice
- Her clit became the world

What is GUNS about

- Guns is about vulnerable destruction, yanno, It’s the vulnerability it takes to destroy something or someone. I don’t like conflict, I don’t like death, but the more I see the more **it seems** like the only way to move **forward** is **destruction**, this destruction many times takes place in our minds, but sometimes it spills out. GUNS represents the use of force, the ability to destroy things and the realization that the destruction of what you thought about the world and the feelings that come with it. Destruction and rebuilding is a must, it leaves you vulnerable to changes unseen. I have changed myself in ways that seem almost psychopathic, but to me this is the only way it could have happened. It’s not something I like to do, but it must be done. 

  

The album itself has fleeting moments of euphoria, happiness for the moment, but the tension underneath is still there.

  

  

“New Cowboys song”

This is the new form of travel, the land has been conquered, but the has been taken from us, we are searching for new grounds, grounds not yet know, we are new cowboys.

“Pastrami, Salami, and all them girls around me”

  

The only thing that makes me do anything is knowing I’m going to get older and die, The least I can do is explain what I see through art, that’s about the only thing I can do that gives me anything, people don’t really excite me, because people are fleeting, art survives and tells a recursive story that should resonate past the destruction. I realized at a young age im not meant to be happy, I will never feel contentment for my work or anything other than nature, that is the only contentment I have. Power, money, homes, these are falsettos screaming Loud enough most don’t hear the voice telling them the truth inside. That truth is a weight unbearable, truly a weight that can pummel even the hartiest of stock unless you give yourself to something. Leading an average life is not how you do that. Thats a scream louder than that truth, but at some point it screams back, hopefully you hear it before is screams so loud it blows your ears out and you can’t hear anymore.

  

I think maybe if I can make something that changes the way people think or make people feel something beyond the scream, Im doing my job and I feel a momentary state of satisfaction, it doesn’t last that long though.

  

I have a sort of sincism to some degree but its more of a realization that is just impossible to content with in ignorance.If it was up to me I would just drive around all day, and all night looking at stuff, But I need money and want to justify my existence to some degree, whatever neurosis that stems from. Some of the best memories of my life were just driving around as teenagers with my friends, that’s about as good as it has gotten for me, I haven’t felt that high since then, that in tuned since. 

  

Marriage and Kids is a representation of that to some degree, try running but at some point it becomes a Noia. It tries to eat you. The 

  

I can’t help but see my dogs point of life, Now I don’t know if he’s happy in the moment like everyone says he’s just there, he’s happy when things happen but moment to moment there isn’t happiness.

  

These things Im saying also are not as deep and complex as they seem, many people say these exact sentiments in words or actions, its just I’ve created something people like and have deemed my words worthy of listening too, what im saying is not new, there is nothing new. Just interpretations.

  

To be good at anything sucks. But its also good.

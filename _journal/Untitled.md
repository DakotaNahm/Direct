<!-- #  Modern Rights of Passage -->

I am very thankful for the past few years and in some ways for the past decade. It's forced me though what I can only describe as modern rights of passage. Every society and culture has rights of passage and as the complexity of a society and culture increases so too does its rights of passage. The modern rights of passage for western society much like the society's itself is full of falsehoods and pitfalls that if not carefully observed will lead one into a sudo awakening. The later form of awakening will have the individual adopt a capitalist or other ideological form of slave consciousness [[Feb-20-2025]] for the benefit of a self serving form of enlightement.

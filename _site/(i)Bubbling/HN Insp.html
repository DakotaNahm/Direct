<p>Immortal lust</p>

<p>Each Album has a secret sound that sort of blends into songs. A little beep or something.</p>

<p>I don’t really have a story, so it’s kind of tough, maybe its repression, don’t really know. Cut grass don’t smell no more. Cant fall asleep now, makes me violent. My only solace is sleep. Not really cool. </p>

<p>Do you hear me?</p>

<p>Do you hear me?</p>

<p>Do you hear me?</p>

<p>I don’t have a story, not many people do, we are just visitors, then we go. Will a story make it better, even a bad one? Will it make the wrinkles worth while? Even the deep ones? Will it make the time feel worth it? Even the hard ones? </p>

<p>Carpet patterns dirty dog hair, she’s loosing it. Mourning doves are gone, morning coffee drank, do they day then hang it up.</p>

<p>The year 2000, the millennium, where do we go from here.</p>

<p>A little mutations cause a lot of stress.</p>

<p>“RUNNING”</p>

<ul>
  <li>after running we would run and get some sonic.</li>
</ul>

<p>“ you threw me the moon, and then wrestle the dog, you were forever”</p>

<p>2021 I was sick</p>

<p>2022 I was twisted</p>

<p>2023 I saw it end</p>

<p>Now I’m here</p>

<p>gold in fire</p>

<p>Purgatory</p>

<p>Made of America a little lazy, and comforted by the guns we tote lately.</p>

<p>Take image of you Fukase, with your blond hair franks raven. Will I love you</p>

<p>Later maybe…. Will I love you later, maybe…</p>

<p>I have a feeling this is going to go by really fast</p>

<p>It’s exhausting to be obsessed</p>

<p>My body keeps the score</p>

<p>“it felt better when I smelled the chemicals of summer“</p>

<p>“Drinking red bull, haven’t changed in days, walk my dog, see the kids play”</p>

<p>I need to be selfish to do this, but I’m usually not</p>

<p>“The road must look so long fororor him”</p>

</ul>

<p>End of “boys don’t cry magazine”</p>

<p>First part ofsong 0-20, second part is after that</p>

<p>False forms of the sublime</p>

<p>Go to the office, gain some, come home watch the office, but she’s gorgeous, you lucked out man. A song about my future self if I was more complacent and normall</p>

<p>Add Amore by Demibby to beginning or ending of song.</p>

<p>Two hot takes : episode 86, her voice splits at the beginning and it sounds really cool</p>

<p>Heavy bass on one song, like SHE - Tyler the creator bass boosted</p>

  <li>sinking</li>
</ul>

<p>“And that’s the great con of life—-to feel alive—-to realize it’s all a clock that counts demise—-to see yourself floating with your head held high, once you see the dark below you, you can’t float or you die.”</p>

<p>“And it’s easy to swim, swim, swim, when the floaties have been tied tight, but you will find one day, that the air has gone by, and the time is now passing, muscles start to cramp, cramp, cramp. The sharks are now swimming and you can’t help but look in the past”</p>

<p>“Now your sinking in those feelings, of the life that flies by, don’t look now or you’ll miss it, it’s time to run wild”</p>

<p>“You’ll see money, kids and luxury to quell the darkness that lives under, but is it all trick for that sinking feeling to be plundered”</p>

<p>“Was that as good as it gets, is it all underwater from here, just keep your head up a little longer, maybe that lifeboat will appear”</p>

<p>“Dont remember this on me.”</p>

<p>Thank you for existing.</p>

<p>Beware the background texture</p>

<p>“And it’s a new revival, forgotten everything that was said before cause now it’s different, just scroll a little longer and see if you are listen”</p>

<p>GUNS</p>

<p><em>‘I Liked being nothing With you’</em></p>

<p>GUNS</p>

<p>Changes depending on where you are in life</p>

<p>When you are happy it feels this way, when you are sad it feels this way</p>

<p>Much like a GUNS can save you or kill you… Its a double edged sword.</p>

<p>GUNS is an existential, romantic Masterpiece, nostalgic, dense masterpiece about growing up and seeing things. He questions wether it was his childhood that got him this far deep? Or Wether he was always meant to be here, maybe that’s why his grandfather did what he did… Maybe its destiny.</p>

<p>GUNS is a set of stories through what seems to be multiple peoples lives as they grow older. It’s broken up into 4 sections, each with a narrative focus, it could have something to do with the 4 stages of the Buddhist life, or a person looking back at their life, it’s strange, the timeline can be flipped, it can start forwards or backwards, the song writing makes this so.</p>

<p>sensory pleasure and universal meaning</p>

<p>Synth country song, change something about country, take it and flip it on its head. It’s about how the small town life only works with experience, people will inevitably feel trapped by such a life, it’s just in nature. It’s a ode to bad shit</p>

<p>More Pricks than kicks.</p>

<p>Elvis voice before song</p>

<p>“Hit, now me, whip me stick me, you know, wwweeewww people scream”</p>

<p>Jealousy only </p>

<p>All under tracks on GUNS are released in another album.</p>

  <li>it’s about a farmer addicted to prescription drugs. Hurt his back farming and is given drugs and a pharmacy takes over him, he becomes a farmer for drugs, he starts trying to </li>

<p>What is GUNS about</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guns is about vulnerable destruction, yanno, It’s the vulnerability it takes to destroy something or someone. I don’t like conflict, I don’t like death, but the more I see the more <strong>it seems</strong> like the only way to move <strong>forward</strong> is <strong>destruction</strong>, this destruction many times takes place in our minds, but sometimes it spills out. GUNS represents the use of force, the ability to destroy things and the realization that the destruction of what you thought about the world and the feelings that come with it. Destruction and rebuilding is a must, it leaves you vulnerable to changes unseen. I have changed myself in ways that seem almost psychopathic, but to me this is the only way it could have happened. It’s not something I like to do, but it must be done. </li>
</ul>

<p>The album itself has fleeting moments of euphoria, happiness for the moment, but the tension underneath is still there.</p>

<p>“Pastrami, Salami, and all them girls around me”</p>

<p>The only thing that makes me do anything is knowing I’m going to get older and die, The least I can do is explain what I see through art, that’s about the only thing I can do that gives me anything, people don’t really excite me, because people are fleeting, art survives and tells a recursive story that should resonate past the destruction. I realized at a young age im not meant to be happy, I will never feel contentment for my work or anything other than nature, that is the only contentment I have. Power, money, homes, these are falsettos screaming Loud enough most don’t hear the voice telling them the truth inside. That truth is a weight unbearable, truly a weight that can pummel even the hartiest of stock unless you give yourself to something. Leading an average life is not how you do that. Thats a scream louder than that truth, but at some point it screams back, hopefully you hear it before is screams so loud it blows your ears out and you can’t hear anymore.</p>

<p>I think maybe if I can make something that changes the way people think or make people feel something beyond the scream, Im doing my job and I feel a momentary state of satisfaction, it doesn’t last that long though.</p>

<p>I have a sort of sincism to some degree but its more of a realization that is just impossible to content with in ignorance.If it was up to me I would just drive around all day, and all night looking at stuff, But I need money and want to justify my existence to some degree, whatever neurosis that stems from. Some of the best memories of my life were just driving around as teenagers with my friends, that’s about as good as it has gotten for me, I haven’t felt that high since then, that in tuned since. </p>

<p>Marriage and Kids is a representation of that to some degree, try running but at some point it becomes a Noia. It tries to eat you. The </p>

<p>I can’t help but see my dogs point of life, Now I don’t know if he’s happy in the moment like everyone says he’s just there, he’s happy when things happen but moment to moment there isn’t happiness.</p>

<p>These things Im saying also are not as deep and complex as they seem, many people say these exact sentiments in words or actions, its just I’ve created something people like and have deemed my words worthy of listening too, what im saying is not new, there is nothing new. Just interpretations.</p>

<p>To be good at anything sucks. But its also good.</p>

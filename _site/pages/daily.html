            <p>Another somewhat nice spring day. Winter seems to be dying. Purchasing a old digital camera for better photos. This is what today feels like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d2Vy6wnxFY</p>

<p>There is a class of women that I cant quite come to a definition for. I can now after much practice, in some strange way feel these women’s expressions, reactions, and inability to hold themselves in any sort of regulatory emotional framework. It can also be stated that most have been victim to their actions and its destructive power on relationships yet they persist in this destructive force as though it is life giving. I then envision the decades of neurosis awaiting the suitor this class of women chooses, constant and dull pain of dealing with this type of women will inevitably lead many men to alternative forms of life satisfaction depending typically on temperament. The same goes for men as well, but as a man it is much easier to avoid the men than the women due to the forces of nature.  It is critical for a man to study women and their actions irrational as they may seem to an uneducated man. Because to fulfill a lifetime of satisfaction with the opposite sex requires like most grand pursuits, a great deal of pain, growing and education. And to define women purely in terms of irrationality makes one an easier target for its destruction. Although this definition fits for the ladder class of women it so too fits for that same class of men, who see women from a unidimensional viewpoint in terms of their decision making. One who is educated should see the complexity of this class of decision makers and pick up on the ques that are given when communicating. Once trained in this recognition of temperament, man or women, it should be advised to stay a safe distance, and if needing to communicate do so with caution in every word to protect oneself against an attack be it socially, emotionally or physically.</p>

<p>Music is the best thing humans ever found. It is a form of art that unlike other form do to its potency and package. In 2 minutes you can be bathing in new waves on consciousness, no person I know around me can grab me or pull pleasure from inside me like music can, only the idea of a person from the perspective of a musical piece can hold me just by its existence, an existence only in my head, something that I feel is not exactly healthy. I see a form of you when I hear music, and I know that will make me disappointed in the real you.</p>

            <p>Went to the ER last night. The night tremors got unbearable, I was terrified I wasn’t going to be able to move normally. it was a good thing I went, had dangerously low potassium levels, could have been worse. My health issues don’t seem to ever go away, they just seem to mutate into different issues and continually devastate me every few months.</p>

            <p>I like the concept of the last time you will touch or hold an object you will likely never touch or hold again. For instance I saw a low quality png of a paper ninja star and it made me think there was a last time I touched one of these things and never thought it would be the last time, this happens every day and we dont pay mind because most objects we touch dont hold this very specific type of significance. The items that strike deepest to the core of this phenomenon are typically childhood and adolescent items which had very little useful significance however where used in some form of playful banter. These items over many years become dusty memories, items like funny erasers, or penis sketching markers. I hold these items as the banter of my child and they are good things inside me.</p>

            <p>Sufferings necessity reveals itself as the truth of experience in destroying the framework inside you that will become your life’s quest is to re-instantiate from a grand perspective, not grand in terms of scope necessarily although it will have grown, but grand in terms of action. If you do not do this nothing substantial will happen. It is the case however that most crave the feeble arms of the latter. You cannot feel all your being without the ripping and tearing of your internal fabric that shields your full self, and suffering, lacking stimulus and desires are all ways to tear this fabric to expose the naked all you.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology of making unique art via sleep patterns</strong></p>

<p>Unique sleep and wake is a burden on your body and on your mind, but lack of sleep or disruption of deep sleep does do something quite strange. Much like drugs or alcohol, it breaks down a barrier,  a subconscious barrier your brain is too tired to keep up. I commit myself 1 day a week to sleep deprivation of waking in the middle of the night and forcing myself awake. This unlocks worlds and insights I would have never came to with a sober, rested brain. My drug to alter consciousness isn’t a drug at all but a high-jacking of the brains strange systems during the sleep/wake liminality period most sleep through.</p>

<p>I can tell when someone will age poorly just based on physiognomic features like skin-type, jaw shape, cheek shape, eye shape, etc. The same features that present themselves in those who age worse also present themselves in the lower strata of income and intelligence, its funny how poor and stupid people just get walloped at every turn. I guess its the punishment for causing much of the worlds problems.</p>

            <p>Modern car dimensions are absurd. There is no such thing as a small car. The small car is dead, and replaced by the ‘compact’. This trend seems to have arisen in the 2010s and continues to widen and extend everything it can get its hands on. Manufactures use ‘safety’ and new tech as this excuse. There is no amount of safety that will prevent a tractor trailer drifting into your lane, the length only gives it more area to hit. And the new ‘tech’ is what I call ‘tesla-tech’, fart noises and funny screens; unneeded clutter. Here are some examples of the lengthening over the past decade or so.</p>

<p>Honda Accord {2005 Length: 187.6”, 2025 Length: 195.7” } = Increase of 8 Inches in length
Toyota Corolla {2005 Length: 178.3″, 2025 Length: 182.5″} = Increase of 4 Inches
Toyota Camry {2005 Length: 189.2″, 2025 Length: 193.5″} = Increase of 4 Inches
Ford Ranger {2005 Length: 190”, 2025 Length: 210”} = Increase of about 20 inches
Rav4 {2005 Length: 166”, 2025 Length: 180.9”} = Increase of 14.9 Inches</p>

<p>I understand you don’t want you family to be crushed so add more airbags and crumple zones, but that doesn’t mean take out every small car from every lineup.</p>

<p>My friends and I are going to build a full size, operational gundam out of old Lada riva’s, its inner control system will be written in a mixture of english, german and manderin.</p>

<p>Today was the first day in months I worked outside.</p>

<p>Life was better with bruised shins…</p>

<p>There is very little spiritual difference between a Siberian mining town, a Chinese factory town and an old Appalachian coal town. The spirits are the same, this resonates in the dreams as well.</p>

<p>2001 gmc with light rust.</p>

<p>Crypto inuits hunting normie caribou.</p>

<p>I can sit and stare at the ground for hours, at the woods for hours, at the sky for hours, do nothing for hours, Are these hours wasted? To some yes, to me no. they are some of the most profound moments, that a creature on earth can sit and lavish in it all for hours on end.</p>

<p>I have a friend who dwells in the lower slave consciousness. he loves family guy, watches sports, and works at a warehouse but our connection is beyond such things, because I just like him.</p>

<p>Capitalists most oppressive aspects are enjoyed by its victims, just walk through Walmart.</p>

<p>Every trip to get gas or a burger is art, its a gift and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>You’re still crawling here too huh?</p>

            <p>learning to write is the best thing a human can do. Language forces us to think in terms of language which seems to not be the inherit human communication method, so to master language and writing is to master a mode of thinking. Learning how to think very well in terms of language also gives you a framework on how to think and communicate in other forms of communication like the body and symbols, although the writers I know don’t seem to know how to use there bodies. The reverse can also be true, the more you master symbols and the body the better a writer you will become. Getting jacked is not mastering your body either.</p>

            <p>Neurosis is worn on the face, in its movement and subtle features, the dropping smile, certain underused or overused facial muscles are an indication to me that you and to a lesser extent your family lineage is perhaps the neurotic kind, the gas station kind, the looping in back on its own hell kind, the never able to escape natures caste kind, the kind I stay away from. It’s ok to stay away from people for the way they look. Do it and see how much your life improves, if you don’t like people who are always frowning, good, that’s something telling you to do that, listen to it, make them change there frown. All this is a form of physiognomic pattern recognition, the insightful individual is better at this pattern recognition and then maps these small patterns to the larger patterns. These pattern fractals over long enough timeframes will produce a clue, an insight into why some people sit at gas stations and why some conquer nations.</p>

            <p>Levels of consciousness. We all slip between and work towards consciousnesses. These are the three that seem to be represented in modern consciousness .</p>

<p>1). Slave Consciousness</p>

- Drugs
- non oriented Ideas
- Emotions
- Low connective or constilitory ability
- Small field of view

<p>2).Work/Art Consciousness <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Goal Oriented
- Goal aligns with highest good
- Goal is in the name of beauty and creation
- Work that produces value
- Growing field of view

<p>3). Child Consciousness</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Closest to god
- Need no creation other than what is created
- Very hard to attain
- Goal orientation is pure experience[^2]
- Large field of view

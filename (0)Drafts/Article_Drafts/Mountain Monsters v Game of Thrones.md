# Mountain Monsters v Game of Thrones


The transidental greatness of Cryptozology Reality TV

The order of realism is spectrum, but each comes with its own set of 
Mountain Monsters
Ghost Adventures
River Monsters
Monster Quest
Finding Bigfoot
Planet Earth
Steve Erwin
Anthony Bourdain No Reservation
90s Goosebumps
Lost Tapes
-----------------------
Pawn Stars
Auctiion Wars
Hardcore Pawn
Bar Rescue
Extreme Cheapscapes
First 48
cash cab
Count Customs


These shows are aligned on both an X and a Y spectrum indiicated by realism, shot selection and overall planning. Shark week fits somehwat snug but not actually capturuing this alllure to its ffuullest extent. Ancient Aliens is played out with little in the way of action.

The Bell curve in action. These shows are the true story tellers, the beleivers and enjorers at each end. In the midddle, the reddit skeptic, thhe game of thrones enjoyer. Mountain Monsters is better than game of thrones. An electric feeling as these shows were paramount to the youung appiilcation tantro. These forces are the greek story tellers realized.

The complexity and hyper sexualization in shows like game of thrones andd to a lesser extent breaking bad are viruses in my opinion, the striving human will come in contact with much of the same symptoms these shows rely on for entertainment, you can live thhhese shows, bbut thhe true stories are made on late 2000s reality tv shows. They were a drama, like WWE bbut better, thhis is what TV was ment for, not an investment of tiime and reasources to understand a narrative, but to sit and enjoy the false but more true thhan any game off thrones epiisode look into the soul drive of humans, child like wondderment off the natural worldd.

The unending curiousiity that accompanies these shows is the steak through the game of throwns heart, no hand holdding, pure experiencing a story, fake or  not. Fake is more real then real.

**Why mountain monsters is better than game of thrones.**

  

Before a scoff and quick glance at some of the words to track down the concept I am trying to rely, just remember that game of thrones was made with millions of dollars per episode.

  

GOT = Hollywood story slop

Mountain Monsters = How humans actually tell stories and continue to tell them.

  

If you have never watched mountain monsters please go and watch the episode linked here. 

  

GOT is overproduced in a tragic way, GOT is driven by the midwit need of constantly evolving paths that are just complex enough by adding and subtracting characters, never really moving, just a rehash of stories already written. Mountain Monsters is on the other hand much more in alignment to how humans were made to understand stories. For the modern person to sit through a show that drags on by introducing characters and branching stories and bullshit means to me that your life is mundane and you are boring. My life is not mundane, my life is not boring, much like the lives of our ancestors. My life is quite stressful and I enjoy it like that. Im poor, breaking my back, and wicked under slept. They did not have the time to sit and binge watch the storytellers tell tales about 30+ character arcs and red herrings. They make the stories memorable, quick and able to be passed along, much like the stories that drive mountain monsters. Scoff as you might, watch the show and get an idea.

  

GOT, when it inhabited the cultural rephrenceshere and 1 hour plus dissertation level breakdowns were being pumped out of the YouTube machine, there was no asking the questions that mountain monsters and shows like it ask, they make you ask deeply philosophical questions about the nature of human story telling, human friendship and enjoyment in the face of stories. GOT derives its pleasure from Walmart-novel esque plot structure. This points to the conclusion that the modern humans need to understand and not wonder makes my heart weap. Most people would watch something like mountain monsters and laugh at it, scoff at the ‘idiotic’ rednecks shooting guns into the night, but what they are is trapped in a story, they are feeling the energy from a tale that has spread through there ‘village’, its memetic in nature. GOT can never and will never produce such things, the most it can produce is a white girl forcing her horny partner to sit through it, so that he might be able to get a pity fuck at the end of it. Her brain so charged with penis, balls and vaginas she will be ready to fuck as soon as it is over. The perversion of this form is not seen in mountain monsters because its pure story telling does not need to piggy back on sex to drive the story.

  

Mountain monsters alludes to something loss an the midwit which is the enjoyment of the subtleties of a tv show, the memetic nature of subtitles from small items the person is wearing to terms used in strange ways. The midwit craves these large and ‘complex’ stories to fill there time away from there typing test job. Mountain monsters is a bell curve meme. Mountain monsters when viewed with dense appreciation is a magical experience to feel and laugh and get stuck in how they are thinking, believe what they are believing like watching a child. This is how humans were ment to tell stories, not over 7 seasons with 100 different characters. That is thought suppression.

  

I like to call this genre the “false-real” which can also be a dangerous genre for the human if not compiled with the real-real. Ive seen many people get sucked into this hole, paintballers, civil war reanacters, train people, the hobby turns into a reality. But is tamed, this can be something great, it can be a reality you go to in story, a fake-real. Game of thrones is just fake, fake. Read the Bible if you want stories. Watch mountain monsters if you want tales.

  

Game of thrones much like Any starwars made after X and you can go on a and on, are anti-life works. Anti-Life works are works that are so comprehensibly complex for no reason other than to get you to come back and watch more. Like a fly to a trap, the person sits and waits for there theory about the house of thordore to be correct, or wether Jeffries was killed by lord whatever, dragon term after buzzword after bullshit. These shows rob people of days worth of combined time.

  

I believe it would be fair to first give a quick matrix how they are similar.

Both shows are escapist in nature, they are watched when not wanting to think about work or school, or how wretched life is. 

Both include fictional monsters

Both Include 

  

If you have time don’t cater to what your friend says when they say “You have to watch it, eyes lit up with moth light!”. Be different and watch A group of hillbillies track down monsters in the woods for a much more human experience, pick up on the small things, the landscape, the funny things they wear, poor animation style, constantly changing description of the monster, constitnalty different ways in which the monster kills you.

  

Game of thrones lines in the fantasy casm

- The fantasy casm is a real nightmarish place, all the worst of attention whore tv lives here.

  

  

Mountain Monsters shot selection is on par with finding Bigfoot and all the other mid to lat 2000s and 2010’s reality travel / cryptid television shows.

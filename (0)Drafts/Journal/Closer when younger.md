# Closer when younger

You were most likley much closer to god when you were younger, then the drift away due to a multi-variable thing, only to be reunited. This pattern, ignorant control, to loss to enlightened control is the path many educated will face, the same path that someone like Charlotte Fang knew when planning the rants I imagine, that is where my admiration comes from. He used it in the correct form but for nefarious somewhat narcissistic reasons, this is just my opinion and I could be wrong, but credit where credit is due.
